## Overview 

I have always wanted my own website and as an up and coming developer I thought that it would be a good opertunity to not only progress my skills with a personal project but also to make something that I can use to present my past and future projects through.  

I had previously made a [prototype static portfolio](https://github.com/JamesRobionyRogers/HTML-Portfolio) using HTML. I wanted to get gain experience working with external data sources by displaying my pinned repositories using Github's API. To accomplish this, I decided to migrate my portfolio to React.


## Built With

* **Framework:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org) 
* **Styling:** [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) **&** [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)
* **API** [Github GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)
<br>

* **Alert Library:** [Sweet Alert Library](https://sweetalert2.github.io)

- `src/components` - Small components used to make up the sections
